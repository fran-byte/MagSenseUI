# MagSenseUI
# Diagnostic Interface for Magnetic Sensor Calibration in Electromechanical Systems

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The **MagSenseUI** project was developed to address a specific diagnostic challenge in electromechanical systems—particularly in machines like **Bill Validators** that rely on magnetic sensors for operation.

The program includes an intuitive **menu** system that allows users to configure the **sensor gain** and choose the data output mode. Users can select whether the magnetic field readings are displayed directly on the OLED screen or streamed via the Arduino's **serial port** to a connected PC. This flexibility makes it easy to adapt the system for both standalone field diagnostics and detailed data logging or analysis on a computer.

- Although the sensor appears to be mounted on the PCB, it is actually connected to it by wires in order to improve its performance and maneuverability.

- Another important point to consider is the use of jumpers J1 and J2, which are used to configure the different versions of the 1.3" OLED displays, as the power supply pins are reversed (positive and negative) in some versions.

### 🧩 Problem Context

These machines often operate in environments where **strong neodymium magnets** are permanently present. While these magnets are essential to the machine’s function, they also create a **constant magnetic field** that can interfere with nearby components.

One such component is the **metallic bearing**. Under normal conditions, the bearing is non-magnetic. However, if it becomes **magnetized due to external contamination** (e.g., exposure to magnetic particles or prolonged proximity to strong fields), it can **distort the local magnetic environment**. This distortion may lead to **false readings or operational errors** in the machine’s magnetic sensors.

### 🧪 Why MagSenseUI?

While a traditional compass can detect strong magnetization, it **fails to detect subtle or low-level magnetization**. This is where **MagSenseUI** excels.

- It uses the **MLX90393** high-resolution 3-axis magnetometer to **detect even slight magnetic anomalies**.
- The system allows the user to **select different gain levels**, enhancing sensitivity to weak fields.
- Through a simple OLED interface and serial output mode, it provides **real-time feedback** on the magnetic field strength in microteslas (µT).
- This enables technicians to **identify which bearing is magnetized**, even if the magnetization is minimal and invisible to conventional tools.

### I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

I²C is a two-wire communication protocol used to connect microcontrollers with peripheral devices like sensors, displays, and EEPROMs.


I²C uses 2 lines: SDA (data) and SCL (clock)

It works between a master (e.g. Arduino) and one or more slaves (e.g. sensor)

The master:

1. Starts the communication

2. Sends the slave’s address

3. Sends or requests data

4. Ends the communication

Each bit is sent with a clock pulse

Common because it allows multiple devices with just two wires


### I²C Clock (SCL)

In I²C, the clock (SCL) is **not a continuous or fixed-frequency signal**. 

It's controlled by the master, may pause, and its timing can vary.  
SCL acts as a **synchronization signal**, not a typical free-running clock.
